== Overview
NEUROSYM.scm defines the symbolic semantics and algebra of operations used by the SCuM constellation. This includes composition, inversion (when defined), verification hooks, and proof obligation surfaces.

NEUROSYM defines meaning. It does not grant permission.

== Scope
This repository defines:
* Operation semantics (forward and, where applicable, inverse)
* Composition rules and typing
* Proof obligation interfaces for claims (verified vs unverified)

This repository does not define:
* Constitutional authority and precedence (META)
* Operational gating (AGENTIC)
* Plan derivation (PLAYBOOK)
* State persistence format (STATE)

== Terminology
Normative terms MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, MAY follow RFC 2119 / RFC 8174.

== Hierarchy and Logic
NEUROSYM is subordinate to META.

NEUROSYM:
* MUST be deterministic and unambiguous
* MUST separate semantic truth from policy permission
* MUST expose proof obligations for any claimed properties
* MUST support verification hooks used by STATE/ECOSYSTEM checks

Failure to discharge a proof obligation MUST downgrade the claim (e.g., from verified to unverified) but MUST NOT silently preserve the stronger claim.

== Normative Execution Pipeline
Implementations MUST consult NEUROSYM semantics prior to proof discharge and prior to classifying actions (reversible/compensable/irreversible).

== Composition and Inversion
Operations MUST declare:
* forward semantics
* declared inverse semantics (if any)
* claim type (verified/unverified/irreversible)
* entropy/cost accumulation behavior

Composition MUST preserve declared invariants and MUST surface accumulated cost and risk.
